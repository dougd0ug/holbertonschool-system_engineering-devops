Application Server vs Web Server

Infrastructure

- 1 Load Balancer (HAProxy) → distributes traffic between servers, cluster-enabled for redundancy.

- 1 Web Server → handles HTTP/S requests, serves static content.

- 1 Application Server → runs business logic, processes requests from web server.

- 1 Database Server (MySQL) → stores persistent data, separate from web/app servers.

Why Split Components

- Separation of concerns → easier maintenance & debugging.

- Scalability → you can scale web servers and app servers independently.

- Fault isolation → one server failure doesn’t take down entire stack.

- Security → database isolated, restricted access.

Key Points

- HAProxy distributes requests using round-robin or least connections.

- Web server is first entry point; app server executes logic; database stores/retrieves data.

- Each server can be monitored separately.
